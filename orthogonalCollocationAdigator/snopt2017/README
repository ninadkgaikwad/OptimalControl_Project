This directory contains the precompiled Matlab mexfiles for SNOPT and SQOPT.
The mexfiles should be compatible with most versions of Matlab.

Linux                      *mexa64             gfortran 5.4
Mac OS                     *mexmaci64-ifort    Intel ifort

Windows (32-bit Matlab)    *mexw32             VS/Intel

NOTES:
----------------
Linux and MacOS mex-files are built against the BLAS library included with Matlab.
The Windows mex-files are built using the BLAS subroutines included with SNOPT.

Please see http://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/ for information on compiling and using
SNOPT in Matlab.


----------------
NOTES FOR MACOS:
----------------
For Mac OS, we provide Matlab files compiled with gfortran 4.3 and ifort, the Intel
Fortran compiler.

The gfortran version should be compatible with most versions of Matlab.
The ifort    version should be compatible with Matlab versions: R2015a and later.

You will also need to rename the precompiled mexfile by removing "-ifort" or "-gfort" in
order to use it.
